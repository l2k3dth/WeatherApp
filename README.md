# WeatherApp
## Setup
### Client
* `cd Client` then `npm install`
* once finished installing `npm start`

### Server
* Ensure that `WeatherApp.Web` is the start up project
* run the application

## Testing

* Just a note on the E2E tests, as they were done using Selenium web driver i have included the `chromedriver` to be placed into the \WeatherApp.Tests.E2E\bin\Debug\netcoreapp3.1 directory, this driver will only work with chrome 94.

##misc
* Due to only having access to VS on my work laptop i have had to omit using Docker due to the inability to install Wsl from the Microsoft store which has disabled by group policy
